from typing import Callable

from .handler import Handler


class EphemeralMessageHandler(Handler):
    """The EphemeralMessage handler class. Used to handle new ephemeral messages: messages that only the current
    user or bot can see. It is intended to be used with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`.

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_ephemeral_message` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new ephemeral message arrives. It takes *(client,
            ephemeral_message)* as positional arguments (look at the section below for a detailed
            description).

        filters (:obj:`Filters`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of updates to be passed in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the handler.

        ephemeral_message (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.EphemeralMessage`):
            The received ephemeral message.
